<p>Simple steps to post your organization's volunteer opportunities on All for Good</p>
<p>All for Good can help your organization reach a wider audience by distributing your volunteer activities through the site. If you have fewer than five hundred volunteer opportunities, the simplest way to have them included is by submitting them through an online spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Online spreadsheets let you easily coordinate volunteer opportunities across offices and within a single team by inviting others to collaborate on the same spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://tinyurl.com/footprint-spreadsheet-template">http://tinyurl.com/footprint-spreadsheet-template</a> and follow the instructions on the sheet.</p>
<p>For reference, the instructions are:</p>
<p> 1. Copy the spreadsheet linked to above (Go to &quot;File&quot; on the menu, and then go to &quot;Create a Copy&quot;).  You can name the new copy anything.<br />
  2. Delete the example events and add your own events.  Do not change the columns or add new ones.<br />
  3. Publish the spreadsheet by clicking on &quot;Share&quot; in the upper right-hand corner, then click on &quot;Publish as a web page&quot;, then select &quot;Automatically republish when changes are made.&quot;<br />
  4. Find your spreadsheet's web address by clicking &quot;Share&quot; then &quot;Get the link to share.&quot; Right-click on the link and select &quot;Copy.&quot; <br />
  5. Visit http://footprint2009dev.appspot.com/sheetchecker/check, right-click and select &quot;Paste&quot; in the box that says &quot;spreadsheet URL.&quot; This will check your spreadsheet for data errors.<br />
  6. Once there are no errors, submit the spreadsheet using <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=cndYaTY4alBybzQ5bFR2a25iR25qdWc6MA">this submission form</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>Note: We reserve the right to stop displaying any item that doesn't comply with the All for Good Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<p>Update your spreadsheet as necessary. Once accepted, changes will be reflected within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Your spreadsheet will be &quot;loaded&quot; (also called &quot;crawled&quot;) and if everything works, your opportunities will be part of All for Good. Be careful when making final edits!</p>
<p>Google Spreadsheets makes it easy to import from Excel documents, but we don't recommend this because it's tricky to match the template format that Google Spreadshset scripts read. Instead, use cut and paste (from Excel to your browser) to move data into the spreadsheet. </p>
<p>Changes to the provided spreadsheets automatically go live within 24 hours, so be careful when editing.  If you have major changes, feel free to re-submit a new sheet (a copy) for testing.</p>
<p>If your organization doesn't have a URL to link back to for volunteer opportunities, include as much information as possible in your spreadsheet. </p>
