<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Are you looking for ways to give back to your community? All for Good makes it simple to find and
share volunteer opportunities on a national level--or even in your own backyard.

<p>Inspired by the call of President Obama to engage more Americans in
service, a group of individuals from the technology, marketing and
public sector dedicated their time towards building an open-source
application managed by Google engineers that allows you to find and
share volunteer opportunities.  Browse opportunities and find events
based on your location or interests.

<p>Even better - sign in with your primary social network to connect with
friends, discover new activities and share interesting
opportunities. Doing good is more fun together!


<h3>How did All for Good get started?</h3>

<p>When President Obama called on Americans to get out and serve, it started some of us thinking &#8212; how can we
personally help better our communities and get more people to volunteer, too? The more we talked to other people,
the more we realized, we weren't alone in these thoughts. All this chatter ultimately turned into a groundswell of
individuals from varied backgrounds &#8212; technology, marketing, academia, non-profit&#8212; coming together to volunteer their
time and talents to create All for Good.

<p>From that initial spark of inspiration provided by the President's call to action, our ad hoc crew has worked on
this labor of love to bring it to life. Companies and organizations joined in and donated resources to help turn a
shared idea into a reality.

<p>Now that we've gotten it started, we're looking to you, the community at large, to help us innovate and grow All
for Good.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>Doing good takes many forms. Some people plant trees (trees are good!). Some people
build houses. Some people create technology.

<p>We are a self-organized, motley crew of software engineers, marketing managers, product developers
and designers who have underestimated the cups of coffee and lines of code it would take to create All for Good.
But, we know that if it improves your community or changes someones life, then the lost sleep is all worth
it.

<p>Our core team is made up of volunteering enthusiasts from places like Google, Craigslist Foundation,
YouTube, FanFeedr and Aha! Ink. These same people have, in the past, worked at companies including
MTV, Apple, Songbird, Yahoo!, and LinkedIn &#8212; a testament to the scope of innovative ideas and technology
experiences that were used in creating this site.Many people applied time, talent and persistence to make this
project possible. (If we could list them all here, we would, but frankly it would take too long for you to read.
And your time is more valuable than that. The less time you spend reading this, the more time you have to
volunteer! Right?) But that's just the beginning.

<p>Each of you is now part of this team! As a community, we will work together to grow
and scale All for Good to offer a great volunteer experience. You can innovate and own the platform! You can drive
the growth and direction of the website.
