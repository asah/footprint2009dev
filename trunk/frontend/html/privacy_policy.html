<p>The All For Good website is hosted by Google, as such, for the purposes of personal information, the website operates as any other Google service. </p>
<p>At Google we recognize that privacy is important, the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a> describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including information provided when you use All For Good.  The Google Privacy Policy only applies to Google's hosting of the All For Good website. </p>
<p>The following describes our practices that are specific to All For Good. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>The following type of information is collected when you use the All For Good website (&quot;Site&quot;) or the All For Good gadget:</p>
<p> * If you log into the Site using a third party social networking service such as Friend Connect or Facebook (&quot;Social Service&quot;), the Social Service sends Google a numeric ID corresponding to your user identification as well as authentication credentials.  The authentication credentials are stored temporarily and will be deleted based on the expiry date set by the Social Service.   Google stores the numeric ID sent by the Social Services, along with certain website activity that requires user identification (such as when you share an item, add an item or add an event to your calendar), in order to provide you with the ability to review your activities on the Site.  You can delete the numeric ID and corresponding data from Google's servers by following the process outlined under &quot;Your Choices&quot; below.  Residual copies of deleted data may take up to 60 days to be deleted from our active servers and may remain in our offline backup systems.  No friend list information is collected by the Site. <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Third party Social Services may use persistent cookies to authenticate sign-in and to remember users when they return to the Site.  Google has no access to these cookies. <br />

We use this data to provide the All For Good service to you. <br />
