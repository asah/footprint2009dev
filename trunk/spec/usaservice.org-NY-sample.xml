        <title><![CDATA[Family of Woodstock - Hotline Training]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/education/4v4t4</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Family of Woodstock Hotline is holding a new volunteer training beginning February 21, 2009. If you know anyone who would be interested in volunteering, please ask them to call 845.338.2370 and schedule an interview appointment. If any Program Director would like to have staff join us, please let Tamara or Sue know.Training dates are as follows: Saturday &amp; Sunday &#8211; Feb. 21st &amp; 22nd Tuesday &#8211; Feb. 24th Saturday &amp; Sunday &#8211; Feb. 28th &amp; March 1st Tuesday &#8211; March 3rd Tuesday &#8211; March 10th

The training introduces a host of community resources, both within and outside of the FAMILY organization. But it is the power of listening that takes center stage in the training experience. People often say that the FAMILY Volunteer Training transformed their lives: they learned to communicate with their wives or children; they really came to understand how difficult life is for so many of their neighbors; they felt the power of realizing they can make a difference in someone else&#8217;s life.

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/other/4vz7l</link>
        <description><![CDATA[I am the owner of the Henrietta Animal Hospital. I am establishing a free veterinary health clinic for people with dogs and cats. This is for those people who have recently lost their jobs, lost thier homes, become disabled, are elderly and on a fixed income and cannot afford basic medical care for their pets. We will also make this available to familes of veterans or have family members overseas in war areas.

I have contacted major corporations to donate vaccine, food, medications for deworming, for flea and tick control and heartworm prevention.


We are currently reaching out to the Rochester community via the following organizations..
The American Red Cross, Catholic Family Charities, Jewish Family Service, Open Door Mission, Salvation Army,Veteran's Outreach Center, and Visiting Nurse Service

Currently we have enough volunteers. Anyone wishing to bring their pet to the clinic MMUST pre register.
Registration forms are available at www.henriettahosp.com or by calling 334-3800.

Forms must be mailed or faxed or delivered by 2/19/09]]></description>

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/other/4vgqh</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Four of the big drivers of the current economic crisis are (1) ... the housing/mortgage crisis ... (2) the catastrophic loss of jobs ... (3) a dramatic drop in public sector revenues ... and (4) the incompetence and irresponsibility of banking sector leadership. 

This dialog meeting will focus on how micro-banking that has been so successful in some parts of the world might be a part of a US solution to the crisis ... how community banking and micro banking might have useful synergies ... how mortgage workouts can be done so that those that have profited now pay. Are there lessons to learn from Grameen, ASA and BRAC. How can young people become engaged in the work that needs to be done ... schools, universities, post college young people. 

We have met before at Pete's Tavern in Manhattan. Would you like to come ... but where would you like it to be? How many should be the limit for a good discussion?

The plan is for 7 pm on Monday evening ... February 23rd.]]></description>

A Computer In Every Home Campaign

Fulfilling President Obama&#8217;s Dream!
e-ClickingForAComputer Campaign - pay-per click/view Ad program that allows clickers to earn rebate bucks for the purchase of computers. Users click on approximately 33 Ads per day over 12 - 18 month period (depends on per-click fee advertisers elect to pay) and purchase a new computer with the rebate bucks. Financing program available that allows clickers to receive the computers NOW and pay with rebate bucks earned clicking on Ads. Our goal is to provide our advertisers/sponsor an On-line Audience which hopefully becomes customers, but also provide computers to households which currently may not have a computer or is in need of an updated computer. 

Join GridPAGES Campaign!

By joining, you provide advertisers a better option; if you consider that direct marketing costs per mailing exceeds $1 each, a far better approach is to get a computer into every household and deliver Ads, News, etc. on-line. At our suggested per click/view fee of .42&cent; (price of 1st class postage) per Ad click/view, our incentive based approach make a whole lot of sense and presents an Eco friendly option to direct marketing mailings.

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/dayofservicejanuary19/4jtg2</link>
        <description><![CDATA[The Hope Project started in January of 2009 at a public school located outside a housing project in Brooklyn, NY. A large percentage of the children in this school are coming from low income families. This school is in need of added resources to &#8220;level the playing field,&#8221; for the children. Each month, we read to 251 children and distribute books to each child. 
The book that was read to each class in January was Something Beautiful by Sharon Dennis Wyeth. The main theme was that there is something beautiful about all of us; we just have to find what that something beautiful is. In February, we read Beatrice&#8217;s Goat to each class. Beatrice&#8217;s Goat is a story of a little Ugandan girl who wanted to attend school but could not because her family could not afford to pay her school fees. It&#8217;s a story of Hope and dreams. Please join us in March to read to a class at this school.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[BEACON Connections Seminars are locally sponsored networking events that match talented professionals and executives in transition with local small business owners and sole proprietors in need. Our seminars are quick, productive and positive experiences for business owners and transitional talent alike. In a 2-hour, session 30 individuals (15 business owners and 15 professionals) come together to offer their experience and explain their needs. They leave with the promise of connecting over the coming weeks to share ideas or contacts to help solve real business problems. The goal is to provide people who need a job with something meaningful and productive while they have time, and to use that talent to keep small business owners from falling victim to economic conditions. In the process, relationships are built that can grow and blossom. This seminar is sponsored by Christ's Church, Rye, NY and TheGardenBench.org. For event pricing, more detailed information and to register, visit us at www.TheGardenBench.org, click on Register for Seminars.]]></description>

In a 2-hour, session 30 individuals (15 business owners and 15 professionals) come together to offer their experience and explain their needs. They leave with the promise of connecting over the coming weeks to share ideas or contacts to help solve real business problems. The goal is to provide people who need a job with something meaningful and productive while they have time, and to use that talent to keep small business owners from falling victim to economic conditions. In the process, relationships are built that can grow and blossom. This seminar is sponsored by Christ's Church, Rye, NY and TheGardenBench.org.

        <title><![CDATA[Ulster Literacy Association Tutor Training Workshop]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/education/4v4d4</link>
        <description><![CDATA[18 hour training over 3 Saturdays, 4/18, 4/25, 5/2.
8:30-3:30 on all dates
635 Broadway, Kingston, 331-6837

The ULA student waiting list has reached 100! This means all these folks are waiting patiently to meet a tutor and get started on building their reading, writing and conversational skills. 

This workshop is to train adult volunteers to work in a one-to-one tutoring situation with adults who want to improve their reading and writing skills. To be a tutor one needs to be a high school graduate or hold a GED. The workshop will include methods and materials, cultural considerations, and discussions concerning the typical needs of persons seeking literacy assistance.

There is a fee of $20.00 to cover the cost of material and handouts. This is due at the time you sign up for a specific workshop. See Tutor Application form below to mail to us, or just give us a call at 331-6837.

The first half hour of the workshop is structured to give information and answer questions from prospective tutors so that there can be a clear understanding of what the workshop and the tutoring will entail. After that the workshop officially begins for those who choose to go forward toward becoming a tutor.

After the workshop, the ULA office will help tutor-student pairs find a mutually convenient public place to work together. It is expected that the tutor will meet with the student once or twice a week for about 1&amp;frac12; hours at a time. Meeting times can be weekdays, weekends, days or evenings; arrangements are made to fit both the tutor and the student's availability. It is hoped that the tutor will tutor for at least a year. Many people thoroughly enjoy tutoring because the work is very rewarding, interesting and satisfying. The workshop also gives an opportunity to meet others who share that interest in volunteer work.

        <title><![CDATA[Ulster Literacy Association Tutor Training Workshop]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/education/4v4yx</link>
        <description><![CDATA[18 hour training Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays May 12, 14, 19, 21, 26, 28
6:00-9:00PM on all dates
635 Broadway, Kingston, 331-6837

The ULA student waiting list has reached 100! This means all these folks are waiting patiently to meet a tutor and get started on building their reading, writing and conversational skills. 

This workshop is to train adult volunteers to work in a one-to-one tutoring situation with adults who want to improve their reading and writing skills. To be a tutor one needs to be a high school graduate or hold a GED. The workshop will include methods and materials, cultural considerations, and discussions concerning the typical needs of persons seeking literacy assistance.

There is a fee of $20.00 to cover the cost of material and handouts. This is due at the time you sign up for a specific workshop. See Tutor Application form below to mail to us, or just give us a call at 331-6837.

The first half hour of the workshop is structured to give information and answer questions from prospective tutors so that there can be a clear understanding of what the workshop and the tutoring will entail. After that the workshop officially begins for those who choose to go forward toward becoming a tutor.

After the workshop, the ULA office will help tutor-student pairs find a mutually convenient public place to work together. It is expected that the tutor will meet with the student once or twice a week for about 1&amp;frac12; hours at a time. Meeting times can be weekdays, weekends, days or evenings; arrangements are made to fit both the tutor and the student's availability. It is hoped that the tutor will tutor for at least a year. Many people thoroughly enjoy tutoring because the work is very rewarding, interesting and satisfying. The workshop also gives an opportunity to meet others who share that interest in volunteer work.

        <title><![CDATA[Dispute Resolution Center Basic Mediation Training]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/education/4v489</link>
        <description><![CDATA[The Dispute Resolution Center of Ulster County is currently recruiting volunteers for its Court and Community mediations programs. Our 32 hour Basic Mediation Training for new volunteers will be held June 5th, 6th, 11th and 12th, 2009 in Ellenville, NY.

Becoming an active mediator for the Dispute Resolution Center is one the best ways to enter the field of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). During the 32 hour Basic Mediation Training you will receive knowledge and experience needed to become a volunteer community mediator. The training will be provided by Roz Magidson, MPA and Executive Director of the DRC. Roz has been Executive Director of the DRC for 19 years and is a Lead Trainer certified by the office of ADR programs, New York State Unified Court System. The training will include lectures, role plays, case studies and demonstrations that are designed to instill the skills needed by successful mediators. Participants will learn ways to manage conflict constructively and effectively, communication skills for their personal and professional life as well as specific mediation skills needed to join the DRC mediator panel.


The minimum age to volunteer is 18 years old. There is a separate training program for youth in conjunction with the schools, although we have had some youth go through our Basic Training and find it very valuable, so we would welcome youth in the training, but could not promise them a volunteer position as a result of taking the training. We do also require new volunteers to complete a brief application and interview before registering for the training. Anyone who is interested should contact Colleen Mulready at 845-331-6136.

The Ulster County office of the DRC, located on Broadway in Kingston, is a non-profit community mediation center offering free or low cost mediation services to all residents of Ulster County for a wide variety of issues including small claims, neighbors, co-workers, businesses, consumer/merchant, lanlord/tenant, enviornmental, agricultural, special education, parent/child, custody/visitation, child support, legal separation and divorce. Our mediators also go into the Town and Village courts in the county to mediate small claims disputes.

DRC mediators are volunteers with varied professional backgrounds including law, business, counseling, education and social work. Mediators are specially trained and highly skilled in assisting people in conflict to reach mutually agreeable solutions.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Community-wide candle light vigil event being held on October 12, 2009 at 7:00P.M. in your neighborhood. The Rotary Clubs of Amherst, N.Y. , Amherst Central School District, along with the Erie County Literacy Volunteers want the involvement of all members of our community at their businesses, and or their homes locations to participate with this Vigil. We are proposing to capture an Aerial picture of the town of Amherst, initiating the launching of a literacy campaign. We are looking to take this event out into other communities as well but we want Amherst, New York to be the spot light of this vigil. We have selected October 12th in the remembrance of the storm we know as the &#8220;October Surprise&#8221;. Our community came together to help our neighbors, it is essential to ensure that special efforts are made to mobilize this event as well.

This is a fund raising event:

        <description><![CDATA[Please note that this project is ongoing. You can submit your letter at anytime.


Letter writing was once the dominant form of information exchange. A physical document traveled from the hands of the sender to the hands of the recipient. New Technologies have destroyed that. We now have a million different ways to share our experiences and identities with increasing velocity and immediacy. The apparent distance between sender and recipient has vanished. There is no physical evidence that the exchange happened at all. There is nothing to hold.

The letters to Obama project will combine the old, dead art of letter writing with the new art of digital storytelling. Participants will write a letter and mail it to President Obama at the White House. There will be a paper trail. 

Additionally, the letter will serve as a dialogue a short digital film. The letter writers will read their letter as a voice-over and collaborate with a professional filmmaker to collect images that illustrate their story. 

I want you to take this opportunity to tell President Obama, and the rest of us, who you are and where you hope to be in the future. I would like the letter writers to show the world who they are and how they fit into and cope with the world and its transformation. 
The overall goal of the project is to create a space where we can observe and share our identities and lives in this moment in time. 

The video letters will be collected on an internet channel and on a website. The projects will start in the NYC area where I will produce and edit each one. I will then expand the project world wide to other filmmakers who want to participate. 


Letter writers should compose a letter to President Obama that can be read in three minutes or less. 
Tips:
Try not to start out with "my name is"; we are making a really short videos and it is best to reveal your name only at the end (in your signature line)
Letters should focus on one or two things that you are passionate about. If you are passionate about a lot of things you can write more than one letter. 
Think visually. What images illustrate your letter?
When you are done please email your letter to ahouseunited@gmail.com


After you submit your letter we will discuss any changes that may be needed to make it amore effective story. We will then set up a place and time to shoot your video. It should not take more than 1 1/2 hours to shoot. Your finished video will be posted 2-3 days after the shoot.]]></description>
