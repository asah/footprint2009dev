Responsible for over half of the nation&#8217;s blood supply, the American Red Cross collects blood from approximately 4.5 million donors, which provides more than 6 million units of blood annually for those in need nationwide. The American Red Cross provides numerous ways for volunteers to donate blood. Last year in Santa Cruz County we held 86 blood drives and collected 3,751 units of blood! Every Blood Donation has the potential to save up to 3 lives. 

Appointments are not required, but will reduce your time at the drive. To register, please visit www.givelife.org. We are unable to accept appointments through usaservice.org at this time.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[A Good Idea (www.agoodideasf.org), a San Francisco nonprofit will host it's monthly Call to Arms event on Friday, February 20th. The exact starting point will either be at Fort Mason or Civic Center and from there we will walk around the city handing out sleeping bags, blankets, warm clothes, and hot chocolate to the homeless members of the community. Our last Call to Arms was on National Service Day and can be read about here:

After serving the community, everyone will get together at a local bar to get to know one another and socialize. If you are interested, please RSVP her and send me an email to jared@agoodideasf.org with your email address and I'll add you to the AGI events/meeting mailing list.

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/civicampcommunity/4v424</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Please join us for DTC's Feb. volunteer opportunity with the Santa Monica Baykeeper and UCLA's Institute of the Environment.

We'll help to help restore the only remaining section of unburied creek on the UCLA campus. The once mighty Stone Canyon Creek was a dominant feature of the UCLA campus in the past. Over the years, as the campus expanded, the creek was forced underground and now only this small segment behind the Anderson School of Business remains. The vegetation that persists at the creek site is dominated by invasive vegetation which is choking out the few remaining native plant species.

We'll be helping to pull an infestation of invasive vegetation, which will really benefit the environment. The newly established vegetation will serve as habitat to birds and other wildlife on campus.

We will meet behind the Andersen school of business at Charles Young Drive and Westwood Plaza (off Sunset Blvd. Parking lot 4). For directions and/or a map visit www.smbaykeeper.org

**Santa Monica Baykeeper will provide all the tools and training but we need your muscle!

We'll be outside, so wear sturdy shoes and bring water, hat and sunscreen.

I'll be carpooling once again from Redondo Beach so contact me if you want a spot.

Hope to see you there!

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/other/4vzpt</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Real Talk: The Urban Life is a forum that gives young people, ages 16 to 25, a chance to voice their opinions on the state of society today. It takes a look at what the society portrays as okay through music, television, and print media, and compares it to what young people really think. 

Real Talk: The Urban Life gives young people an avenue to express to their community leaders and whoever will lend an ear: the real issues that they face on a day-to-day basis, how they deal with those issues, and, what they are doing or will do to bring about change. 

Each forum is a quarterly, 3-hour open discussion, called a rap session, that targets a specific subject of high importance as defined by current events and/or local community issues. Both the male and female perspective is expressed through an all-female and all-male rap session followed by a unisex open forum where a panel of community leaders will help to provide a more seasoned perspective on the issues and make efforts on any possible initiatives that may arise.

Through this forum, it is hoped that the authentic voice of young people will be heard. It is hoped that this generation will step out from beneath the cloud of media influence and define what&#8217;s really up, for themselves. 

As the future generation of America and the world, young people must and will stand up, speak out, and be heard!]]></description>

Homeless animals need your help. These dogs and cats need human companionship to remind them what a loving family could be like. The time volunteers spend socializing these abused, abandoned and needy dogs and cats helps to make them adoptable and increases the odds that the shelter can find them new homes.

Volunteers will socialize dogs, cats, puppies and kittens by walking, playing and showering them with affection and attention. We'll also help around the shelter by filling water bowls, cleaning cat furniture, and generally lending a hand.

        <title><![CDATA[Fresh Produce Food Drive]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/civicampcommunity/4v4rl</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Overages of Oranges?
Zillions of Zucchini?
Lots of Lemons?

Please join SoCal Harvest and Food Finders of Long Beach in helping provide fresh, healthy produce to food banks in our city.

The main goal of this food drive is to give people with excess produce from their fruit trees and gardens a place to share that excess with those in need. Just drop your produce on my front porch any Sunday and it will be delivered to a Long Beach food bank on Monday. (Additional drop-off locations will be added in the future.)

The address is 1809 Tulane Ave., Long Beach, CA 90815.

This weekly food drive is just one effort that SoCal Harvest is putting together to help connect gardeners with those in hunger. Please contact us at info@socalharvest.org or visit our website at www.socalharvest.org for more information.]]></description>

Responsible for over half of the nation&#8217;s blood supply, the American Red Cross collects blood from approximately 4.5 million donors, which provides more than 6 million units of blood annually for those in need nationwide.

        <description><![CDATA[Price For Freedom.com
DESCRIPTION: I have an ambitious goal but one that would help restore the following back to the hearts, minds and souls of new generation Americans that need to re-connect to the old principals of our founding fathers. Our founding fathers were not only bold, believers, and proud of their new found independence, but they also understood the price that had to be paid to maintain those freedoms. My plan is to re-generate an old ("sponsorship program"T.M. ) As the government is aware not all companies and Americans are hurting, and those that are not and have life left in their balloon, can share and sponsor those that have lost most if not everything. This plan requires government participation in tax-credit-off-set-incentives, (TCOFSI) that are based on (Participation Credits) PC's can be accumulated and stored in a (credit bank). As the PC's grow in the participants account, the incentives also grow, in other words the bigger the better and the longer the better. The theory is build upon an idea that savers are the same, they save cash or they save credits (same principal)..... The second part of my plan is to determine the basis to issue these PC's and the values attributed to them for the different sponsorship programs that are currently active in the program. It could also work like a "Cross-Industry" barter system. Sponsors would bank PC's and those being sponsored can exchange the "volunteer services" that they contribute to the specific they are donating their time too. The system becomes self-fulfilling and perpetual (I am a bad speller, sorry). The program would be based upon many different programs i.e. (community trash cleanup); (corporate compliance advocates); (food bank expansion); (cloth drives and collections); (homeless housing); (rent-adjusted sponsorship's); ...... I have many ideas for different beneficial programs that could be supported by those who still have helping those have-not's but the program has incentives. The helpers get tax-based incentive offset credit's and those being helped are also in turn helping others and "earning" the PC's that they can save, barter, or exchange to help with their own living situations and challenges. I visualize many supermarkets, farmers, builders, bankers, auto dealers utilizing these programs and taking advantage of reducing inventories through these earned PC's ..... I visualize the helper's who participate having pride in themselves, there children having pride in their parents and all those that help and participate get recognized on a government sponsored reality show produced by Simon Cowell (for example) which highlights and gives attention to the bigger participants and formally recognizes those participants helping to rebuild American one brick at a time, based on old ideology, blended with new innovation and thinking. Thanks for the time, Keith Freitas

        <title><![CDATA[Stolen Music Instrument Recovery Project]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/other/4vgdl</link>
        <description><![CDATA[We are seeing if we can use social networks to help musicians get back their stolen music instruments.

Every year over one million instruments are stolen from musicians. Police recover less than 3%. The real tragedy is that musicians bond with their instruments - having an instrument stolen is more like losing a friend - it is not easily replaced. And with increasing budget cuts, police are devoting fewer resources towards solving instrument thefts.

By publicizing instrument thefts, we hope that more people can help look for stolen instruments and help get them back into the hands of the musicians. On a grander scale, we hope that this can help reduce crime by making stolen instruments more difficult to sell.

This is less of an event than a movement to help keep the instruments in the hands of the musicians.

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/environment/4vzy3</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Save Our Beach conducts a monthly beach cleanup on the 4th Saturday of every month from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the 1st Street Beach Lot (corner of Ocean and 1st in the Rivers End restaurant parking lot) in Seal Beach.

30 Minutes is not a huge commitment, but a lot of people, focused on a single worthwhile project for a mere 1/2 hour can produce some startling results, and thanks to you, we can see the difference we're making. Help us keep trash off of our beach and out of our ocean. Kids of all ages are welcome!

As always, we provide parking passes, garbage bags, protective gloves, drinking water, hand sanitizers (AND certificates if you need one for school credit or community service).

All you need to bring is closed toe shoes and sunscreen! We're there rain or shine. More questions? Please email Kim kim@saveourbeach.org or call Kim at (562) 884-6764. Hope to see you in the sand!]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[readingdogs.org
We are looking for dogs and their owners with at least one hour per week to listen to children read to the dogs on a one-on-one basis. Children learn the joy of reading and gain self-confidence by reading to non-judgmental dogs. We are mainly in the greater LA or Orange County areas, and will assign you to a school in your neighborhood. 

This is an ongoing event, not just the one day, but there is no option on this site for an ongoing program.]]></description>

Responsible for over half of the nation's blood supply, the American Red Cross collects blood from approximately 4.5 million donors, which provides more than 6 million units of blood annually for those in need nationwide.

Every Blood Donation has the potential to save up to 3 lives. Appointments are not required, but will reduce your time at the drive. To register, please visit www.givelife.org.

Must RSVP - Contact: Linda Velez at 949-400-4596 - call for credit card charges

Please help your contribution can save a life any size donation are welcome..and ;s a Tax write off

We want to thank everyone who has donated to this worthy cause - participating in helping Russ with the funds needed for the Neuro-Surgery and Neurological Parkinson's therapy treatments that he needs. 

The cost for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) surgery is between $80,000-$125,000 without counting the therapy treatments needed for many months after the initial surgery. Insurance bailed out as a pre-existing condition.

Since July several donations have been trickling in, so far it has generated an additional $11,145 dollars towards the fund. We are still needing to raise a much larger amount to meet the total needed to proceed forward until we meet our goal of at least $80,000.

        <description><![CDATA[Donating Blood is giving the gift of life. Responsible for over half of the nation&#8217;s blood supply, the American Red Cross collects blood from approximately 4.5 million donors, which provides more than 6 million units of blood annually for those in need nationwide. The American Red Cross provides numerous ways for volunteers to donate blood. Last year in Santa Cruz County we held 86 blood drives and collected 3,751 units of blood! Every Blood Donation has the potential to save up to 3 lives. 

Appointments are not required, but will reduce your time at the drive. To register, please visit www.givelife.org. We are unable to accept appointments through usaservice.org at this time.]]></description>

So, this time, March 14, Saturday at 9am -- let us all meet for coffee and croissants and help us make this vision a reality. The back alleys are ours to improve!!]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[On Sunday, March 15th, A Good Idea (www.agoodideasf.org) will host it's 3rd Intentional Acts of Kindness. As always, we'll start at the Ferry Building and make our way throughout the city eventually ending up at Union Square. In Union Square, we'll have set-up in "living room" fashion a place where people can sit down, have a bite to eat, and talk about ways they'd change the world. The goal will be to get people dreaming big, realizing that anything is possible, and start taking steps to creating positive social change in their own little way. Here's an article that was in the SF Examiner from our last IAOK:

http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Group_spread_vibes_of_positivity_across_The_City.html

If you are interested in taking part please RSVP and send me an email to jared@agoodideasf.org with your email address if you'd like to be added to AGI's mailing list for meetings and events.

Thanks!

        <description><![CDATA[Please visit HandsOn Inland Empire's Web site at http://www.handsoninlandempire.org to register and sign-up for this project. Volunteers must be at least 18 years of age.

The elderly citizens of the Portofino Villas in Pomona love to receive visitors, but don't often get them. Here's your chance to make a difference and develop a rewarding relationship with someone who will deeply values your company. Each month we are looking to gather a group of volunteers to share in some fun times with the senior by engaging them in an afternoon of board games and snacks. Volunteers can bring their favorite board game to play or to donate a gameor puzzle to Hands On for future use for this project. Volunteers are also asked to bring a HEALTHY snack to serve at least 10 people, some snack suggestions are: sugar free snacks, low sodium crackers,veggies, fruits, and water.

Engage is a non profit organization who's vision is to make aging a beginning. They provide life-enhancing programs to low- and moderate-income seniors living in affordable apartment communities in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The programs give the residents the opportunity to continue to grow intellectually, creatively and emotionally. The idea is to promote active engagement and independent living, and to provide seniors with a purpose. 

Volunteers must be at least 12 years of age.

Roseville, CA - The Hispanic Empowerment Association of Roseville (HEAR) will sponsor the 9th Annual Cesar E. Chavez Youth Leadership Conference and Education Fair for any 6th to 12 graders and their parents. The educational fair will have college recruiters and information designed to empower families to become stronger advocates for their children's education. 

The Conference will take place on Saturday, March 21, 2009 from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM at Robert C. Cooley Middle School located at 9300 Prairie Woods Way in Roseville, CA 95747 which is about 25 miles east of Sacramento of the State Capitol. 

Take Interstate 80 toward Roseville and then take exit #106 toward Lincoln/Marysville on Highway 65 North and go 3.3 miles to the Blue Oaks Blvd./ Washington Blvd. exit onto Blue Oaks Blvd West- go 2.5 miles and turn left on Prairie Woods Way as Cooley Middle is the right. 

1,000 sixth to twelve graders attended last year and 500 parents. The event is free and pre-registration is not required but suggested. Pre-registration is available by downloading conference information at http://www.hear2000.org 

The Conference began nine years ago in the Roseville City School District by Board Trustee, Rene Aguilera, and kicks off one of many upcoming Cesar Chavez State Holiday Events. Email Rene Aguilera at raguilera [at] surewest.net or reach him on his cell at 916-532-5998. 

Cesar Chavez was co-founder and president of the United Farm Workers, leading the union from the 1960s to his death at age 66 in 1993 and organized farm workers in several states. In 2000, Governor Gray Davis signed SB 984, asking that school districts give an hour of instruction in all schools around Chavez's March 31 Birthday about the UFW founder's lessons on non-violence, self-sacrifice and social justice. Then, in the afternoon, students are to engage in some form of public service appropriate for their age and grade called the Cesar Chavez Day of Service of Learning. 

The Cesar E. Chavez Youth Leadership Conference supplements what most school districts do on or around March 31, his birthday and acts as a primer for learning said, Aguilera, also the conference coordinator, We ask parents, students, educators and business and community leaders to come out and volunteer their time to teach and learn from each other on both days. 

Workshops for parents, students, educators and business and community leaders will include a seminar on student financial aid and scholarships and career information workshops including law, journalism, military, teaching, social welfare, art, music and dance, medicine, law enforcement and pro athletes. 

The Conference will feature several notable speakers and presenters from the Sacramento area education community and national organizations such as the Sacramento Central Labor Council, California Teacher's Association, Classified School Employees Association, The College Board, Community Colleges, State Universities and University of California Schools, Sacramento Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Mexican American Legal Defense Education Fund, American G.I. Forum, La Raza Lawyers Association, League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino Issues Forum, California Latino School Board Members Association, United Farm Workers of America, Latina Leadership Network, Labor Council of Latin American Advancement, Society of Hispanic Engineer Professionals and the National Council of La Raza.]]></description>

Roseville, CA - The Hispanic Empowerment Association of Roseville (HEAR) will sponsor the 9th Annual Cesar E. Chavez Youth Leadership Conference and Education Fair for any 6th to 12 graders and their parents. The educational fair will have college recruiters and information designed to empower families to become stronger advocates for their children's education. 

The Conference will take place on Saturday, March 21, 2009 from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM at Robert C. Cooley Middle School located at 9300 Prairie Woods Way in Roseville, CA 95747 which is about 25 miles east of Sacramento of the State Capitol. 

Take Interstate 80 toward Roseville and then take exit #106 toward Lincoln/Marysville on Highway 65 North and go 3.3 miles to the Blue Oaks Blvd./ Washington Blvd. exit onto Blue Oaks Blvd West- go 2.5 miles and turn left on Prairie Woods Way as Cooley Middle is the right. 

1,000 sixth to twelve graders attended last year and 500 parents. The event is free and pre-registration is not required but suggested. Pre-registration is available by downloading conference information at http://www.hear2000.org 

The Conference began nine years ago in the Roseville City School District by Board Trustee, Rene Aguilera, and kicks off one of many upcoming Cesar Chavez State Holiday Events. Email Rene Aguilera at raguilera [at] surewest.net or reach him on his cell at 916-532-5998. 

Cesar Chavez was co-founder and president of the United Farm Workers, leading the union from the 1960s to his death at age 66 in 1993 and organized farm workers in several states. In 2000, Governor Gray Davis signed SB 984, asking that school districts give an hour of instruction in all schools around Chavez's March 31 Birthday about the UFW founder's lessons on non-violence, self-sacrifice and social justice. Then, in the afternoon, students are to engage in some form of public service appropriate for their age and grade called the Cesar Chavez Day of Service of Learning. 

The Cesar E. Chavez Youth Leadership Conference supplements what most school districts do on or around March 31, his birthday and acts as a primer for learning said, Aguilera, also the conference coordinator, We ask parents, students, educators and business and community leaders to come out and volunteer their time to teach and learn from each other on both days. 

Workshops for parents, students, educators and business and community leaders will include a seminar on student financial aid and scholarships and career information workshops including law, journalism, military, teaching, social welfare, art, music and dance, medicine, law enforcement and pro athletes. 

The Conference will feature several notable speakers and presenters from the Sacramento area education community and national organizations such as the Sacramento Central Labor Council, California Teacher's Association, Classified School Employees Association, The College Board, Community Colleges, State Universities and University of California Schools, Sacramento Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Mexican American Legal Defense Education Fund, American G.I. Forum, La Raza Lawyers Association, League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino Issues Forum, California Latino School Board Members Association, United Farm Workers of America, Latina Leadership Network, Labor Council of Latin American Advancement, Society of Hispanic Engineer Professionals and the National Council of La Raza.]]></db:abstract>

Help us keep trash off of our beach and out of our ocean. Kids of all ages are welcome! As always, we provide parking passes, garbage bags, protective gloves, drinking water, hand sanitizers (AND certificates if you need one for school credit or community service). All you need to bring is closed toe shoes and sunscreen! We're there rain or shine. More questions? Please email Kim kim@saveourbeach.org or call Kim at (562) 884-6764.

(A CA State Holiday)

The UFW Foundation
invites you to the
11th Annual Cesar E. Chavez Day Walk &amp; Festival
(honoring Chavez Day of Service)

Saturday, April 4th, 2009
at
Historic Olvera Street
124 Paseo de la Plaza
Los Angeles, CA 90012

Registration 9am
___

Music, Speakers, Vendor &amp; Information booths and more!


Join the Chavez Family, Dolores Huerta, the farm worker movement, students, community organizations, celebrities, and elected officials.


REGISTER HERE NOW: 
http://www.gifttool.com/athon/AthonDetails?ID=1717&amp;AID=524


SI SE PUEDE! / YES WE CAN!


Honor Cesar's Legacy
and Support Farm Workers
by Forming your own "Si Se Puede Walk Team"
(Schools, families, community groups, businesses)


On this day, we honor Cesar's legacy 
and celebrate the Farm Worker Movement's victories.

Still, we know there is much work to be done, because the laws on the books are not the laws in the fields. This summer alone, nine farm workers died in the fields, while many still do not have the basic rights given to most other workers.

Help us fight for justice for farm workers and other working families, through community education, civic engagement, policy research and advocacy.

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/education/4vztr</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Ready or Not? &#8211; A unique course designed to teach citizens and communities to &#8220;take care of themselves.&#8221; 

By acquiring basic skills and making preparations, citizens can become an asset rather than a liability. Our emergency services personnel are often understaffed and under-budgeted and as our population continues to grow there is an imminent need for individuals and communities to become more self-reliant.

Tom Beasley and Susan Conniry, authors of &#8220;Ready or Not &#8211; A Disaster Survival Handbook&#8221; undertake the unique approach to disaster preparedness by adapting wilderness skills into an urban environment; they show citizens techniques that utilize resources in their immediate environment. By &#8220;creating awareness without precipitating panic,&#8221; they teach communities how to take &#8220;care of themselves.&#8221; They explain the priorities of shelter, water, fire and food, give simple survival techniques and provide enough tools to deal effectively with any emergency situation. 

This class is interactive; please bring a large Russet potato with you!

This course is hosted by the Lakeside Disaster Preparedness Committee and is tuition free. Please RSVP before March 27, 2009. Please provide your email address.]]></description>

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/other/4vgb3</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Kids In Sports (KIS) is a non-profit organization created to provide quality youth sports programs in communities in Los Angeles County that lack or offer few organized, instructional opportunities. 

Kids In Sports currently operates 15 Sports Clubs that deliver sports activities in baseball, basketball, soccer, softball, lacrosse and volleyball, and serves 9,000 youth annually. Boys and girls, ages 5 to 17, participate in year-round sports programs at parks and schools. Regularly scheduled practices and competitions are conducted after school and on weekends during the consecutive sports seasons. 

Each Sports Club is a partnership with the members of the community, parks, schools and Kids In Sports. Parents and other interested adults are recruited to volunteer their time as coaches and Sports Club advisory board members. Organizations such as the city and county departments of recreation and parks, and area schools provide meeting rooms and sports facilities. KIS provides the overall technical assistance and resources to develop the individual Sports Clubs boards, organizes and purchases equipment and uniforms, and pays for officials and referees.

The lifeblood of KIS is our volunteer core of over 700 dedicated community members, and we are always on the lookout for new support. Our winter sports season is currently under way, but we're in the planning stages for our spring/summer leagues. Single day, season long, and year round volunteer opportunities exist at all 15 of our Sports Club locations throughout Los Angeles County. 

Interested indivudals can find out more information by visiting our website at www.kidsinsportsla.org or call us at 213-765-1900]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Donating Blood is giving the gift of life. Responsible for over half of the nation's blood supply, the American Red Cross collects blood from approximately 4.5 million donors, which provides more than 6 million units of blood annually for those in need nationwide. The American Red Cross provides numerous ways for volunteers to donate blood. Last year in Santa Cruz County we held 86 blood drives and collected 3,751 units of blood! Every Blood Donation has the potential to save up to 3 lives. Appointments are not required, but will reduce your time at the drive. To register, please visit www.givelife.org. We are unable to accept appointments through usaservice.org at this time.]]></description>

        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/weekendeventsjanuary17or18/4jg2j</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Thank you for your interest in volunteering for the 2009 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, to be held at UCLA. The Festival of Books began in 1996 with a simple goal: Bring together the people who create books and the people who love to read them. The Festival was an immediate success and has become Southern California's major literary event. The fourteenth annual edition of the Festival of Books will be held on Saturday, April 25 and Sunday, April 26, and we would love to have you join us as a volunteer.

Last year over 130,000 people attended the Festival, which featured almost one hundred ticketed author events, children's storytelling, poetry readings, book signings and nearly 500 exhibitor booths. The Festival's success has been due in part to the generous assistance of volunteers who welcomed attendees, assisted with registration, staffed author events, supervised book signings and much more.

Some details about volunteering:

Volunteers will receive free parking, shuttle service from the parking lot, and lunch.

We will provide t-shirts for volunteers to wear and keep after the event. (Please wear khaki, or beige pants or shorts.)

The majority of volunteer activities require being on your feet for most of your shift. Please wear comfortable shoes.

Volunteers must be 18 years of age or older. You cannot bring children under the age of 18 with you during your shift.

In addition to signing up here - you MUST register on the Festival of Books Volunteer website.
Be sure to visit:
http://www.troutco.com/fob/ 
and fill out the online registration form there!]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[KIDS OCEAN DAY Adopt-A-Beach Clean-Up. Adult volunteers are needed to help manage 4,000 LA school children with a beach clean-up @ Dockweiler State Beach.

www.kidsoceanday.org www.malibufoundation.org www.oceanday.net

Q: What is KIDS OCEAN DAY?

A: KIDS OCEAN DAY is an event that brings thousands of elementary students to the beach to clean and do aerial art. The event&#8217;s goal is to allow students to interact with the environment to truly learn the importance of preserving it. Assemblies precede the event and teach the students about marine animals, the importance of keeping our oceans and beaches clean, and what they can do to help. Events, similar to this, are hosted throughout the state by different organizations. 

Q: What do volunteers need to do to get involved?

A: We have various volunteer positions that are described below, each with different time requirements. Ideally, volunteers should be committed to being at the June event from 5:00am to 1:30pm. The promptness of volunteers to the event, in order to receive training, aid in set-up, and greet the students, is essential. 

Q: What will volunteers be expected to do on the day of the event? 

A: Volunteers will have different jobs depending on their preferences, time of arrival, and the needs of the schools. Some volunteers will work on setting up for the different events of the day including the PA equipment, lunch, greeting buses, registration, and aerial art. The majority of volunteers will be paired up with a bus and leading the students throughout the day. The volunteer and teacher/parent volunteer will help the group of students clean up the beach, play games, and get placed during the aerial art. 

Q: How will I know what to do on the day if the event?

A: A training session will be held on Saturday May 16, 2009 @ Dockweiler State Beach from 10am to 12pm to familiarize volunteers with the location and activities for KIDS OCEAN DAY. This training is mandatory. There also will be another training for the aerial art team on Weds June 3, 2009 @ Dockweiler to rehearse the aerial art performance.

Q: What should I bring on the day of the event?

A: Bring a water bottle, sunscreen, layered clothing. Coffee and bagels will be provided to volunteers at the beginning of the event. Lunch will be provided at the end of the event.

Volunteer Positions:

&uuml; Registration &#8211; Greet the media, VIP contacts, and others as they arrive. Greet local city officials, principals, the media and others as they arrive. Register their names and what city/school/business/organization they represent. Answer their questions and give them information about the event and the Malibu Foundation.


&uuml; Traffic Control &amp; Parking &#8211; Greet and direct the many buses to the correct parking lot.


&uuml; Aerial Art - Set up aerial art: 5:00 am &#8211; 11:00am (with breaks!) 
Feed students into aerial art: 11:30 am &#8211; 12:30pm. Clean after 
aerial art:: 12:30pm -1pm
 

&uuml; Greeters &#8211; Greet the children, teachers and chaperones as they get off their buses. Make sure their bus is well marked and the bus driver is clear on his instructions. Direct the participants to the gathering location on the beach and note what schools and classes you have greeted. Note any absent teachers, students, and classes.


&#8226; Mentors &#8211; Partner up with a group of children and a chaperone. Walk with them through their clean-up and talk with them about their feelings about trash on the beach, what they&#8217;ve learned in their classrooms and how they will continue to make a difference. Direct them to their Aerial Art designated and assist them with the aerial art presentation (i.e., singing songs, environmental chants and stand up art movements) Help lead your group in the beach clean-up, direct to restrooms &amp; water station, keep them on schedule and in their assigned cleanup area 


As the day goes on there will be other needs that arise &#8211; a team effort and a willingness to help out in any way will be necessary. Without your help this program would not be possible &#8211; thank you for your generous heart and enthusiastic spirit!

        <title><![CDATA[Disaster Animal Response Training]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/healthamppublicsafety/4v4jr</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Lamorinda DART is pleased to announce its second DART Team training. Our first training attracted 26 CERT graduates and has laid the foundation for a regional DART team. Our second training will help 25 other CERT graduates to become animal disaster responders.

The training will take 20 hours during which the participants will learn how to set up and manage an animal shelter.

We will cover:

 1. Introduction to DART
 2. Disaster Management
 3. Shelter Operations
 4. Animal Behavior and Temperament
 5. Medical Operations
 6. Decontamination
 7. Transport of Animals
 8. Reunification
 9. Grief Counseling

The theoretical part will be covered in three sessions on Thursdays from 6:30 pm - 10:30 pm. (Training handouts are online. )

There will be two practice sessions where participants will set up a shelter on Saturdays from 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm

Participation is limited to 25 people. CERT Graduates from Lamorinda are invited to sign up. Others can sign up as well, but seating will depend on the number of 'local' participants that register for the training. If, as we assume, there will be a number of open seats, participants will be seated in the order in which they registered. Early registration is therfor vital.

Dates:

 * Thursday 9/10, 9/17 and 9/24 for the theory sessions
 * Saturday 10/3 and 10/10 for the practice sessions.

The training is free. However, Lamorinda DART has received no financial assistance for the preparation or implementation of this training. We would appreciate it VERY MUCH if you would consider making a donation.

        <title><![CDATA[MoDev Foundation for Autism Benefit Concert 2009]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/other/4vzxy</link>
        <description><![CDATA[The MoDev Foundation aids financially disadvantaged families who need assistance in caring for their children with autism and developmental disabilities; to fund education and research into the causes and consequences of childhood autism; and to serve as a clearinghouse and communications center for new programs and sports training development that will provide a gateway to life empowerment and acceptance, giving them the chance to strive and achieve their dreams.
An organization like Special Olympics is often the only place where they have an opportunity to participate in their communities by creating a unique sporting experience that unites athletes with autism and developmental disabilities on the playing field competing side by side leading to a great understanding and acceptance by peers without disabilities. Improve social skills and confidence, not to mention long-lasting friendships and develop a belief in themselves. 
Many live lives of neglect and isolation, hidden away or socially excluded from full participation in schools or society. The lessons learned through sports training impact their life skills, enhances focus and gives participants a structure for learning important lessons about perseverance, endurance and setting goals. 

One of the most inspiring athletes is the Loretta Claiborne&#8217;s story. As a young person, she was told that her future would be in an institution. After discovering athletics through Special Olympics, Loretta became a long-distance runner &#8230; and she hasn&#8217;t stopped since. Over her career, she competed in 25 marathons &#8211; twice finishing in the top 100 women runners in the Boston Marathon. The Women in Sports Hall of Fame inducted her as a member, and Runner's World magazine named her Special Athlete of the Quarter Century. Loretta speaks four languages and holds honorary doctorate degrees &#8211; the first person with intellectual disabilities known to receive such honors. Her life was the basis for Disney film, &#8220;The Loretta Claiborne Story&#8221;. In 1996, she received the coveted Arthur Ashe Award for Courage. 

These are towering achievements, by any standards. Not all athlete&#8217;s with developmental disabilities are like Loretta, but each one takes away from the experience a newly found voice, a sense of accomplishment and a joy of friendship.

        <description><![CDATA[Donating Blood is giving the gift of life. Responsible for over half of the nation's blood supply, the American Red Cross collects blood from approximately 4.5 million donors, which provides more than 6 million units of blood annually for those in need nationwide. The American Red Cross provides numerous ways for volunteers to donate blood. Last year in Santa Cruz County we held 86 blood drives and collected 3,751 units of blood! Every Blood Donation has the potential to save up to 3 lives. Appointments are not required, but will reduce your time at the drive. To register, please visit www.givelife.org. We are unable to accept appointments through usaservice.org at this time.]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[Fundamental "Bata" Drum Prayer]]></title>
        <link>http://www.usaservice.org/page/event/detail/other/4vkz4</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Our votes have created a great historical event, the reality of having a President Elect, Barack Obama, that may be able to bring much needed change to America.
This is a great opportunity and I suspect that this country and the world will never be the same again. We know that the present economic situation is difficult. We need our President elect to lead the way and help us enter a new era of peace and prosperity. 
Olodumare, Orisha, Egun, &amp; all the powers know the outcome, however If&amp;Atilde;&#402;makes changing the course towards a better tomorrow possible through knowledge and propitiation. We as creatures of growth and evolution have great hopes for a better tomorrow filled with the belief that we are part of the solution.

 For me, this means working to ensure that women and women's range of perspectives are included from top to bottom in the new Administration. 
At this moment, I am calling on our President Elect to not only expand diversity, and represent all minoritites, but also include the leadership of women in his new team. 

Our country, our world, this moment is calling upon us. We are in trouble and we need everyone to take a helping role. 
You are "it." 
Several years ago, after the tragedy of 9/11, some of us came together atop Twin Peaks in San Francisco and played "Bata" for everyone that was lost that day. Our religious community was very supportive. I felt that our praise songs and prayers were received. Now, we need to come together again as one religious community to sing and pray to the Orishas &amp; the Ancestors to keep a protective eye over President Elect Barack Obama and his family throughout his entire term in office.

Each and everyone of you in our religious community is entreated to participate in the planning of this event from a desire to help our President Elect and to heal our nation. 

To accomplish this event, we will need drummers, musicians in general, so bring your shekeres (beaded gourds), acheres (rattles), agogo (iron bells), etc., as well as singers. Most of all and of great importance is to attempt 100% religious community participation. 
This statement is a collaboration of concerned priests.

Alaafia,

Baba SomiLeke

California, .....

Please, I hope to hear from everyone for suggestions on where it would be the best place to come together as a religious community and which day of the week will be suitable for everyone. At your earliest convenience, please contact me at (415) 573-5525 or email me somileke@yahoo.com.]]></description>
