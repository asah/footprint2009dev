					<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2009 Volunteer Programme  <br /> The staff and children of our Partner schools in Mukono and Mpigi are looking for 20 teams of 12 Volunteers to work with them for 3 months these terms of the year. <br />Applications for the 09 Programme are now open.  We have some opportunities for people to volunteer in our Mukono offices <br />We received almost 200 applications last year and the standard has been extremely high.  Shortlisted candidates were invited to start off their placements in their most interested areas.  The aim of this type of assessment (which includes an individual and group interview) is to select well balanced, high fit teams to meet the needs of the placement and the challenges of the programme.  .  <br />Volunteer program<br />The Programme provides an opportunity to volunteer in a community-based school or educational project in Uganda every month. Since 2007, 57 volunteers have taken part in the Volunteer Programme working with our projects for almost six months, while learning about different cultures. <br />It offers the possibility to develop personal and professional skills, to work in a team, and to learn about the challenges and opportunities of development in our interconnected world.  <br />What can you do?<br />You can attend any of our events in Uganda, create a society in your area, learn about and discuss global issues, make a donation to support our work, volunteer some time to help us out or, become our volunteer agent in your area, from the middle of February 2009; you can apply to join our volunteer program in Uganda.  We are also grateful for the long-term support of the Friends of BoHU <br /><br />What is Beacon of Hope Uganda (Youth Empowerment Department) about?<br />Vision<br />Our vision is a world where all young people are given the opportunity to realise their potential to effect positive change in our society. <br />Mission<br />Beacon of Hope Uganda is a movement dedicated to supporting quality education in under-resourced communities. <br />Overview<br />Beacon of Hope Uganda Educational Development has partnerships with education NGOs in Uganda and outside, as well as a network of 24 students’ societies across Uganda and outside. Through the partnerships, we support the education of thousands of children in primary schools and increase the capacity of our partner NGOs to benefit their communities.<br />The societies outside Uganda fundraise for the schools in Uganda, hold events and courses to engage the public in these issues and run mentoring programmes to address educational disadvantage in their communities. <br />Strategic Framework<br />The next stage of our strategy will be developed within the following framework: <br /><br />Educate:  We will support partner education organisations, catering for 3 to 18 year olds, in under-resourced communities that share similar values to Beacon of Hope Uganda. <br /><br />Engage:  We will engage our active and passionate youthful volunteers in learning through service and fundraising programmes that address educational disadvantage. <br /><br />Inspire: We will develop programmes that help young people to be better informed and connected with global issues with a view to engaging them in our vision and mission.  <br /><br /><br />Values and Principles<br />Our core values have evolved over the first three years of our existence. We expect all BoHU volunteers to subscribe to these beliefs. We will only seek partnerships with organisations that could show demonstrable evidence of sharing similar values. <br />Education: We believe the type of education an individual receives can considerably influence their likelihood of achieving their potential and playing a meaningful role in shaping their communities. We believe a holistic education combines formal education, the acquisition of a broad range of skills, a process of self-discovery and substantial exposure to both community and global perspectives. <br />Role of Young People: We believe investing in young people is essential for long-term sustainable change in the world. Our work is personified in the vibrancy, passion, optimism and energy of youthful people of all nationalities who we seek to engage as volunteers. We believe strongly in the value of peer-to-peer education. <br />Partnerships: We believe maximum impact can be achieved through effective collaborations between the social, government and private sectors and by employing the unique skills of each. We believe the objectives of the education organisations that we seek to partner with must always be to the forefront of our thinking. <br />Respect &amp; Diversity: We believe in the innate dignity of all people and believe we share an underlying common humanity. We believe in a society where an individual’s opportunity is defined not by their network, geography, colour or creed but by their own ambition, potential and fundamental rights. We are secular and respect and value diversity including religious diversity. <br />Local Solutions: We believe the problems of any community have to be overcome by the members of that community. We support local solutions to local problems. <br />Leadership &amp; Society: We believe that leadership is best learnt through service to others, understanding their needs and putting them first.  We believe that we all have a role in shaping our society. We just need individual responsibility, the collective will and capacity to effect change. We believe that we can best serve where our leadership talents meet the needs of communities.<br /><br /><br /></div>
